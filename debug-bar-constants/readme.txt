== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can it be used on live site ? =
**PLEASE DON'T!** Amongst the defined constants are your database credentials, so you really do not want to do this.
This plugin is only meant to be used for development purposes.

= What are constants ? =
[From PHP.net:](http://php.net/language.constants)
> A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script. A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.

> Like superglobals, the scope of a constant is global. You can access constants anywhere in your script without regard to scope. For more information on scope, read the manual section on [variable scope](http://php.net/language.variables.scope).
